# LV-MAGIC: Logic Synthesis and Verification for MAGIC based In-Memory Computing

LV-MAGIC is based on the [alice](https://github.com/lsils/alice), and it can be used for logic synthesis and verification based on memristor-aided logic.

## Requirements
### A modern compiler is required to build the libraries. Compiled successfully with Clang 6.0.1, Clang 12.0.0, GCC 7.3.0, and GCC 8.2.0. 

### Open-Source Logic Synthesis Tools [abc](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc)

## How to Compile
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
